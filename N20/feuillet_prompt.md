**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I want to train a CNN for facial recognition on 10 of the best known characters in harry potter:
- Daniel Radcliffe
- Emma Watson
- Rupert Grint
- Maggie Smith
- Michael Gambon
- Bonnie Wright
- Alan Rickman
- Helena Bonham Carter
- Tom Felton
- Evanna Lynch

The first step is to constitute a training dataset. I would like you to create a script that scraps images from google image with the serch "<actor> Harry Potter". It should get the first 200 results for each. Any questions?

**GitHub Copilot**: No questions. I will create a Python script that scrapes the first 200 Google Images for each actor using the search "<actor> Harry Potter". The images will be downloaded and organized into folders by actor name.

I’ll use the `google_images_download` or `icrawler` library for scraping, as direct scraping of Google Images with requests/selenium is against Google’s terms and often blocked. I’ll also include instructions for installing dependencies.

Proceeding to create the script. 

Created [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/scrape_harry_potter_faces.py)

The script scrape_harry_potter_faces.py is ready. It uses the `icrawler` library to download the first 200 Google Images for each actor with the search "<actor> Harry Potter", saving them in organized folders.

To use:
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install icrawler
   ```
2. Run the script:  
   ```
   python scrape_harry_potter_faces.py
   ```

Let me know if you want any changes or additional features.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Let's do this in a jupyter notebook instead.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Ok the scraping was mostly successful, for each actor between 60 and 80 images were downloaded. Some of the discrepancy from the 200 asked can be explained by certain images returning a 403 or 404 response but not all of it. I'm guessing it tried getting only around the first 100 results. Why is that? 

You can remove the part 4 and 5 from the notebook.

Parts 4 and 5 have been removed from your notebook.

Regarding the image count:  
Google Images and most search engines limit the number of results you can programmatically access. The `icrawler` library typically retrieves only the first 100–150 images, even if you set a higher `max_num`, due to Google’s anti-scraping measures, result pagination, and duplicate filtering. Some images may also be skipped due to broken links, access restrictions (403/404), or failed downloads.

If you need more images, consider using multiple search engines (Bing, DuckDuckGo) or supplementing with manual downloads. Let me know if you want to try another approach.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I see. Well let's try with what we have for the time being. The images we got are not completely clean for face recognition as some images contain multiple faces/people. There are too many images to filter them manually. What approach to automatically clean this dataset for face recognition using a CNN would you suggest?

**GitHub Copilot**: To automatically clean your dataset for face recognition, you should:

1. **Detect faces in each image** using a face detection model (e.g., MTCNN, OpenCV Haar cascades, or a pre-trained deep learning detector).
2. **Crop and save only the largest face** (assuming the main actor is most prominent), or discard images with multiple faces if you want only single-face images.
3. Optionally, **filter by face size** (discard very small faces) and **face quality** (blurred, occluded, etc.).
4. Save the cleaned, cropped faces in new folders for each actor.

Recommended approach:
- Use the MTCNN library (accurate and easy to use) to detect faces.
- For each image, if only one face is detected, crop and save it.
- If multiple faces are detected, either keep the largest or discard the image.

Would you like a notebook cell to automate this cleaning process using MTCNN?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Yes go ahead with the MTCNN. For organisation sake, rename the harry_potter_faces folder to data. Then put every actor folder in a source folder. The clean result of the MTCNN can be put in data/preprocessing. Modify the existing paths in the notebook accordingly

**GitHub Copilot**:

The notebook now:
- Renames the dataset folder to `data`, with actor images in `data/source`.
- Adds a new section and code to clean the dataset using MTCNN, saving cropped faces to `data/preprocessing/<actor>`.

This will automate face extraction and organization for CNN training. Let me know if you want to adjust the cleaning logic (e.g., keep largest face, filter by size, etc.).

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I'm thinking we could do a little more in the preprocessing by already formating the images so that we just have to split them in train/val/test and use them later for training. Also can you add a visualization of the images that were excluded in the preprocessing after in a new cell?

Your notebook now:
- Preprocesses images: crops, resizes to 160x160, saves as JPEG in `data/preprocessing/<actor>`.
- Tracks and visualizes excluded images (no face or multiple faces detected) in a new cell.

You can now easily split the cleaned images for training, validation, and testing. Let me know if you want to automate the split or add further preprocessing steps.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I'd rather use 224x224 for traget size

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

The preprocessing cell now uses 224x224 as the target image size for face crops. All cleaned images will be saved in this format, ready for training. Let me know if you want to further customize the pipeline or automate dataset splitting.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Some images with only one face have been excluded, maybe because len(faces) was 0. In a new cell, run the face detector on the excluded images for Daniel_Radcliffe to separate the between 0 face and more than 1 face detected. Then add some visualisation of the result

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

Two new cells have been added:
- One separates Daniel Radcliffe's excluded images into those with 0 faces and those with more than 1 face detected.
- The next visualizes samples from each group.

You can now inspect which images were excluded for each reason and adjust your preprocessing if needed. Let me know if you want to automate recovery or further refine the pipeline.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: There is a mistake in the new cell, you used a \ before a ' in a string which escaped it. The whole logic in this list could be simplified by only checking for Daniel_Radcliffe regardless of slashes

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

The cell now correctly filters excluded images for Daniel Radcliffe by simply checking if "Daniel_Radcliffe" is in the path, regardless of slashes. The logic is simplified and will work for all OS path formats. Let me know if you need further refinements or want to apply similar analysis to other actors.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I want to see the number of images per actor in preprocessing with a bar plot

A new cell has been added to visualize the number of preprocessed images per actor in preprocessing using a bar plot. This will help you quickly assess the dataset balance after cleaning. Let me know if you need further analysis or want to automate dataset splitting.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Ok I would of hoped for more images but let's try with this. Let's now split the images in train/val/test folders. For each actor, the val and test folders should contain a minimum of 4 images while aiming for a 80/10/10 split

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

A new cell has been added to split the preprocessed images for each actor into train, val, and test folders.  
- The split aims for 80/10/10, but ensures at least 4 images in both val and test sets per actor.
- Images are copied to `data/train/<actor>`, `data/val/<actor>`, and `data/test/<actor>`.

You can now use these folders for model training and evaluation. Let me know if you want a summary of the split or further automation.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Ok now for the model itself, I want to use MobileNetV2 as a base model. I also want to have early stopping, reduced lr on plateau and saving the best model as callbacks. Any questions ?

**GitHub Copilot**: No questions. I will:
- Add a markdown cell introducing the model training section.
- Build a TensorFlow/Keras model using MobileNetV2 as the base (with pre-trained weights, fine-tuned for your classes).
- Add callbacks: EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, and ModelCheckpoint to save the best model.

- Training (with callbacks) is performed in the next cell, with an introductory markdown cell.

Let me know if you want to visualize training history, evaluate on the test set, or proceed with predictions.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I'm confused, the summary seems to show a summary of MobileNetV2. I want MobileNetV2 to show as non trainable layer in my model. There should be additional trainable layers after

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

The model now includes additional trainable layers (Dense, BatchNormalization, Dropout) after the frozen MobileNetV2 base. The summary will show MobileNetV2 as non-trainable and the new layers as trainable. Let me know if you want to adjust the architecture or proceed to training and evaluation.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Why does the summary explodes MobileNetV2 instead of showing it as one layer?

**GitHub Copilot**: In TensorFlow/Keras, when you use a model like MobileNetV2 as a base (with `include_top=False`), it is actually a sequence of layers, not a single layer object. The `model.summary()` method lists all layers in the model, including those inside MobileNetV2, which is why you see a long list of layers instead of a single "MobileNetV2" block.

If you want to see MobileNetV2 as a single layer in the summary, you can wrap it in a `tf.keras.layers.Layer` or use the Functional API with a custom name, but this is not standard practice and may hide important details about the architecture.

For clarity, you can print the trainable status of the base model and the count of trainable vs non-trainable parameters, or use `model.layers` to inspect the top-level layers. Would you like a cell that summarizes this information?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Isn't the issue that we use x = base_model.output rather than x = base_model(x, training=False) ?

**GitHub Copilot**: Yes, that's correct!  
Using `x = base_model.output` just grabs the output tensor, so the summary will show all the layers inside MobileNetV2.  
Using `x = base_model(inputs, training=False)` wraps the base model as a single layer in the new model, so the summary will show MobileNetV2 as one layer (with its name and trainable status), followed by your custom layers.

Would you like me to update the model-building cell to use this approach?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: yes

**GitHub Copilot**: Summarized conversation history

Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

The model-building cell has been updated to use base_model(inputs, training=False) for a cleaner summary. You can now run this cell (Cell 23) to see the improved model summary, where MobileNetV2 will appear as a single layer block in the architecture.

Would you like to proceed with training, evaluation, or further analysis?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Since we have early stopping, let's set the epochs to 100

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

The training cell has been updated to set epochs=100, taking advantage of early stopping. You can now run this cell (Cell 25) to train your model for up to 100 epochs, with early stopping automatically halting training when appropriate.

Let me know if you want to proceed with training, evaluate results, or add further analysis!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I'm getting this warning while training which is clutering the output, can you fix it? 

WARNING:absl:You are saving your model as an HDF5 file via `model.save()` or `keras.saving.save_model(model)`. This file format is considered legacy. We recommend using instead the native Keras format, e.g. `model.save('my_model.keras')` or `keras.saving.save_model(model, 'my_model.keras')`.

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

The training cell now saves the best model in the recommended native Keras format (`best_mobilenetv2.keras`). This will prevent the legacy HDF5 warning from appearing during training.

You can rerun the training cell (Cell 25) and the warning should be gone. Let me know if you need further adjustments or want to proceed with evaluation!

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N20/harry_potter_faces_scraper.ipynb)

The scraping cell now uses the same query "<actor> Harry Potter" with multiple offsets to grab more images per actor. This will help you collect a larger dataset while staying within Google scraping limits.

Run the updated cell to maximize your image count for each actor. Let me know if you want to adjust the number of queries or images per query!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I'm unsatified with the results. There seems to be overfitting (0.98 accuracy on train but 0.5-0.6 on val and test). I think a better preparation of the images could help. What would you suggest?

**GitHub Copilot**: Here are several strategies to improve image preparation and reduce overfitting for your facial recognition dataset:

1. **Data Augmentation**  
   Apply random transformations to training images (rotation, zoom, shift, flip, brightness, contrast, etc.) to increase dataset diversity and help the model generalize.

2. **Face Alignment**  
   Align faces based on detected landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth) so that all faces are similarly oriented and scaled.

3. **Background Removal or Blurring**  
   Reduce background influence by cropping tighter around the face, blurring the background, or masking non-face regions.

4. **Color Normalization**  
   Standardize color channels (mean subtraction, normalization) to reduce lighting and color variance.

5. **Quality Filtering**  
   Exclude low-quality, blurry, or occluded images. You can use image sharpness or face detection confidence as a filter.

6. **Class Balancing**  
   Ensure each actor/class has a similar number of images to prevent class imbalance.

7. **Image Size and Format**  
   Experiment with slightly larger image sizes (e.g., 256x256) or different aspect ratios if faces are being cropped too tightly.

Would you like to implement data augmentation in your TensorFlow pipeline, or try face alignment and quality filtering in preprocessing? I can add code for any of these approaches.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Let's implement data augmentation in the training dataset, face alignement and color normalization in the preprocessing. Also some quality filtering by removing the images that are too low quality

Image preprocessing now includes:
- Face alignment using eye landmarks
- Color normalization (standardization)
- Quality filtering (removes blurry images)

A new section and cell have been added for data augmentation in the TensorFlow training pipeline. Use `train_ds_aug` for model training to benefit from random flips, rotations, zooms, contrast, and translations.

Run the updated preprocessing and use the augmented dataset for training to help reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Let me know if you want to tune augmentation parameters or add more filters!

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: From this notebook, I want you to create a new notebook harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb based on it. I want you to clean it up, create a unified pipepline for image processing from source to prediction. This is to garantee that the exact same transformations are applied to images used for training and new images used for prediction.

**GitHub Copilot**: Created [](file:///home/c.hoareau/workshop/harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb)

A new notebook harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb has been created. It provides a unified pipeline for image processing and face recognition, ensuring that the same transformations are applied to all images for both training and prediction.

Key improvements:
- All image preprocessing (face detection, cropping, resizing, grayscale, normalization) is handled by a single function.
- The same preprocessing is used for training, validation, test, and new prediction images.
- The pipeline is modular and easy to follow: scrape → preprocess → split → train → predict.

You can now use this notebook to guarantee consistent image transformations throughout your workflow. Let me know if you want further customization or code review!

    layers.RandomShear(0.2),  # If using tf-nightly or tf 2.15+, otherwise use Lambda for shear
    RandomNoise(stddev=0.05),
    ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2)
])

It seems to help with overfitting and keeping the train and val loss closer but it also seem to impede the progress of the training as before the CNN reached 0.65 to 0.7 accuracy on test within 25-50 epochs and now it only reached 0.55 in 100. What would be most appropriate for data augmentation?

**GitHub Copilot**: Your current data augmentation pipeline is quite strong, especially with vertical flips, large rotations, and color jitter. While these augmentations help prevent overfitting, they can also make the task harder for the model, especially if some transformations (like vertical flips or strong rotations) are unrealistic for face recognition.

**Recommendations for face recognition data augmentation:**
- **Remove vertical flips**: Faces are rarely upside down in real scenarios.
- **Limit rotation**: Use a smaller rotation range (e.g., 0.1–0.2).
- **Shear**: Use a small value (e.g., 0.1).
- **Color jitter**: Keep moderate values.
- **Random noise**: Use a small stddev (e.g., 0.02).
- **Add horizontal flip**: This is realistic and helpful.

**Example:**
```python
data_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.RandomFlip("horizontal"),
    layers.RandomRotation(0.15),
    layers.RandomShear(0.1),
    RandomNoise(stddev=0.02),
    ColorJitter(brightness=0.1, contrast=0.1, saturation=0.1)
])
```

**Summary:**  
Use realistic augmentations for faces. Too strong or unrealistic transformations can hurt accuracy. Try the above settings and monitor both train and validation accuracy. If accuracy improves and overfitting is still controlled, you have a good balance.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Can you add the execution of the preprocessing?

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/c.hoareau/workshop/harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb)

The notebook now includes a code cell that executes the preprocessing step for all images, saving the processed results to the `preprocessed_dir` for each actor. This ensures your pipeline is complete and ready for dataset splitting and training. 

You can run this new cell after scraping to generate the preprocessed images. Let me know if you need further automation or checks!

OSError: cannot write mode F as JPEG

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/c.hoareau/workshop/harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb)

The error occurred because some images were in mode 'F' (floating point), which cannot be saved as JPEG. I updated the code so that, before saving, images in mode 'F' are converted to mode 'L' (8-bit grayscale), which is compatible with JPEG.

You can now run the cell again—this will prevent the "cannot write mode F as JPEG" error and save all images correctly. Let me know if you need further help!

The prediction function now ensures that input images have 3 channels (RGB), as required by MobileNetV2. Grayscale images are converted to RGB by stacking or concatenating channels.

You can rerun the prediction cell—this will resolve the "expected axis -1 of input shape to have value 3" error. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I'm not getting the same prediction when using predict images on the source images used to create the test dataset then what I got with the test dataset

**GitHub Copilot**: Summarized conversation historyThis issue is likely caused by a difference in preprocessing between the source images and the test dataset images. When you run prediction on a source image, it goes through the `preprocess_image` function, but the test dataset images have already been preprocessed and saved (possibly as grayscale, resized, and normalized differently).

Key differences that can affect predictions:
- The test dataset images are loaded from disk as JPEGs, possibly in grayscale, and may have different normalization or channel format.
- The source images are processed on-the-fly, starting from RGB, and then converted to grayscale and normalized.

To ensure identical preprocessing, you should always run predictions on the preprocessed test images (the same ones used for evaluation), not the raw source images. If you want to compare, use the exact file from `data/test/ActorName/filename.jpg` and pass it through the same prediction function, but skip the face detection and cropping (since it's already done).

**Solution:**  
Add a new prediction function for preprocessed images that:
- Loads the image from the test dataset folder.
- Resizes and normalizes it as needed.
- Ensures it has 3 channels for MobileNetV2.

Would you like me to add this function and a cell to demonstrate consistent predictions using the test dataset images?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: The point is to use the same image processing pipeline on the images to predict then the one used to create the training/testing dataset. So, in theory, if I use the same source images that were used to create the test dataset, I should get the same results when I do a prediction. However this is not what's happening

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/c.hoareau/workshop/harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb)

A new function and example cell have been added to your notebook. You can now use `predict_preprocessed_image` to run predictions on the preprocessed test images (from the test dataset folder). This ensures the exact same pipeline is used as during model evaluation.

To compare results, use the same filename from both the source and test folders:
- For source: use `predict_image` (runs full pipeline, including face detection/cropping).
- For test: use `predict_preprocessed_image` (uses already preprocessed image).

This will help you verify if the difference is due to preprocessing or another factor. Let me know if you need further analysis or want to automate the comparison for all test images.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I don't want to predict on the images in the test , the whole point is to predict on new unprocessed images. Anyway, here is the part for spliting the dataset, there is some processsing of the images before saving and I'm suspecting it could be the reason. Can't that processing be done in the preprocessing direcly, such that the splitting is only that, split preprocessing between train, val and test?

import random
import shutil
def prepare_dataset():
    split_dirs = {'train': os.path.join(data_dir, 'train'), 'val': os.path.join(data_dir, 'val'), 'test': os.path.join(data_dir, 'test')}
    for split in split_dirs.values():
        shutil.rmtree(split)
        os.makedirs(split, exist_ok=True)
    for actor in actors:
        src_dir = os.path.join(preprocessed_dir, actor.replace(' ', '_'))
        images = [f for f in os.listdir(src_dir) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(src_dir, f))]

            'test': images[:n_test],
            'val': images[n_test:n_test+n_val],
            'train': images[n_test+n_val:]
        }

            for img_name in split_imgs:
                src_img_path = os.path.join(src_dir, img_name)
                img_norm = preprocess_image(src_img_path)
                if img_norm is not None:
                    img_pil = Image.fromarray(img_norm.astype('uint8'))
                    if img_pil.mode == 'F':
                        img_pil = img_pil.convert('L')
                    img_pil.save(os.path.join(split_actor_dir, img_name), format='JPEG')

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/c.hoareau/workshop/harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb)

The dataset splitting function has been updated: it now only copies the already preprocessed images into the train, val, and test folders, without reprocessing them. This guarantees that all images in your splits use the exact same preprocessing as the pipeline for new predictions.

Now, when you predict on a new image using the unified preprocessing function, the results should be consistent with those from the test dataset, as both use the same processing steps. Let me know if you need to re-run the split or want to automate further checks.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I just tested this, even here it didn't give the same prediction as what I got using the test dataset to evaluate the model in cell 19

**GitHub Copilot**: This is a common issue in image classification pipelines. Even after copying preprocessed images for splitting, there can still be subtle differences between how images are loaded and processed for single-image prediction versus batch evaluation in TensorFlow datasets.

**Key reasons for prediction mismatch:**
1. **Image Loading Differences:**  
   - `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory` may apply its own normalization, channel handling, or dtype conversion.
   - Manual loading with PIL and NumPy (in your `predict_preprocessed_image` function) may differ in dtype, scaling, or channel order.

2. **Data Augmentation:**  
   - If augmentation is applied during training but not during prediction, results will differ.

3. **Batch vs. Single Image:**  
   - Model behavior (e.g., BatchNorm, Dropout) can differ between training and inference, especially if not set to inference mode.

**How to fix:**  
- Use the exact same loading and preprocessing code for both batch and single-image prediction.
- For single-image prediction, use TensorFlow's image loading utilities to match the dataset pipeline.

**Recommended next step:**  
Add a function that loads a single image using TensorFlow's `tf.keras.utils.load_img` and `tf.keras.utils.img_to_array`, then preprocesses it identically to your dataset pipeline.

Would you like me to add this function and a demo cell to your notebook? This will ensure true consistency between test set evaluation and single-image prediction.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Ok can you replicate the exact process used for training in the prediction function, with saving and loading the image in a temp folder and deleting it after prediction?

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/c.hoareau/workshop/harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb)

A new prediction function has been added that exactly replicates the training pipeline for a single image:

- It preprocesses the image using your unified function.
- Saves it to a temporary folder in the same format as your training data.
- Loads it using `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory` (just like your training/test datasets).
- Runs prediction and prints the sorted class probabilities.
- The temporary folder and image are deleted automatically after prediction.

Use `predict_with_dataset_pipeline(img_path, model, class_names)` for consistent, reproducible predictions matching your training pipeline. Let me know if you want to automate batch predictions or further analysis.

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: oK this seems to work, can you create a function that creates a predict folder in data, identifies the id of the images in the test folder and copies the corresponding images from source into it, organized by actors in folder? Then create a display cell with two selection menu for the actor and the photo, once a photo is selected it's displayed in a small bow, and when the user clicks a predict button is processes it with predict_with_dataset_pipeline, displays the prediction and bellow the top three prediction by confidence score

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/c.hoareau/workshop/harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb)

A new function and interactive cell have been added:

- The function creates a `data/predict` folder, copies the test images from `source` (organized by actor), and matches filenames.
- The interactive cell provides dropdown menus for actor and photo selection, displays the selected image, and runs prediction using the exact training pipeline.
- When you click the "Predict" button, it shows the top prediction and the top three predictions with confidence scores.

You can now visually select and predict on test images, ensuring full pipeline consistency. Let me know if you need further customization or batch analysis.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Can you make it nicer? The loading from tensorflow is displayed, can you remove it?

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/c.hoareau/workshop/harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb)

The interactive prediction UI is now improved:

- TensorFlow loading output is suppressed for a cleaner experience.
- The interface uses a header and a vertical layout for better appearance.
- The "Predict" button is styled for visibility.
- Results are clearly displayed with the top prediction and top three predictions.

You can now use the widget for a more polished and user-friendly prediction workflow. Let me know if you want further enhancements or customizations!

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Can you make it so the image isn't distorted (because of resizing), it should fill a box of a set size. Also the tensorflow loading is still there: 1/1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 0s 26ms/step

Can you remove the prediction for ... print?

Can you substitute the actors name for their character every time it's displayed? 

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/c.hoareau/workshop/harry_potter_face_recognition.ipynb)

The UI is now improved:

- Images are displayed in a fixed-size box (160x160), centered and padded, without distortion.
- All TensorFlow loading and prediction output is fully suppressed.
- The "Prediction for ..." print is removed.
- Actor names are replaced with their character names everywhere in the UI and results.

You now have a clean, visually appealing, and character-focused prediction interface. Let me know if you want further enhancements!

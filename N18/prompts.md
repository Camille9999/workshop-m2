# Chat Export

**Human:** I want to deploy the smallest version of gpt locally using ollama. Guide me through every step.

**Assistant:** To deploy the smallest version of GPT locally using Ollama, follow these steps:

1. **Install Ollama**
Ollama is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. On Linux, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

This will install Ollama and set up the service.

2. **Start Ollama**
After installation, start the Ollama service:

```bash
ollama serve
```

This will run Ollama in the background.

3. **Pull the Smallest GPT Model**
Ollama provides several models. The smallest GPT-like model is usually `llama2:7b` or `phi3:mini`. For minimal resource usage, use `phi3:mini`:

```bash
ollama pull phi3:mini
```

This downloads the model to your machine.

4. **Run the Model Locally**
Start a chat session with the model:

```bash
ollama run phi3:mini
```

You can now interact with the model in your terminal.

5. **Optional: Use Ollama API**
Ollama exposes a REST API at `http://localhost:11434`. You can send requests using `curl` or integrate with other apps.

Example API call:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "phi3:mini",
  "prompt": "Hello, how are you?"
}'
```

Let me know if you want to automate any of these steps or need help with API integration!

**Human:** I have installed ollama and pulled the model. I would now like to interact with it within a locally hosted instance of n8n. Can you guide me through installing n8n?

**Assistant:** To install n8n locally on Linux, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js (if not already installed)**
n8n requires Node.js (v18+ recommended). You can install it using:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

2. **Install n8n globally using npm**
Run:

```bash
npm install -g n8n
```

3. **Start n8n locally**
Launch n8n with:

```bash
n8n
```

By default, n8n will be available at [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678).

Would you like instructions for running n8n as a background service, or for Docker installation?

**Human:** I have successfully installed and lauched n8n. I want to interact with this model with a AI agent in n8n using a chat trigger and an AI model connected to ollama. Guide me through every step to get it working, included creating the credential for ollama using the exposed port.

**Assistant:** Here’s a step-by-step guide to connect n8n to your local Ollama model and interact with it using a chat trigger and AI agent:

1. **Open n8n Editor**
Go to [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678) in your browser.

2. **Create Ollama Credentials in n8n**
In n8n, go to Credentials (left sidebar).
- Click + Create Credential.
- Choose HTTP Request (since Ollama exposes a REST API).
- Set:
  - Name: Ollama Local
  - Base URL: http://localhost:11434
  - Leave authentication blank (Ollama’s local API does not require auth by default).
- Save the credential.

3. **Build Your Workflow**
   a. **Add a Chat Trigger**
   - Click + Add Node.
   - Search for Webhook (for chat-like triggers).
   - Set:
     - HTTP Method: POST
     - Path: /chat
   - Save and activate the workflow to get the webhook URL (e.g., ...)

**Human:** There is a specific ollama credential in n8n, let's use this instead.

**Assistant:** Here’s how to set up n8n to interact with your local Ollama model using the built-in Ollama credential and a chat workflow:

1. **Open n8n in your browser**
Go to [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678).

2. **Create Ollama Credential**
- Go to Credentials (left sidebar).
- Click + New Credential.
- Search for and select Ollama.
- Set the Host to: `http://localhost:11434`
- No authentication is needed for local Ollama by default.
- Save the credential.

3. **Create a New Workflow**
   a. Click + New Workflow.
   b. **Add a Chat Trigger**
   - Search for Chat and add the Chat Trigger node.
   - Configure it as needed (for example, to listen for messages from a web interface or another service).
   c. **Add Ollama Node**
   - Search for Ollama and add the Ollama node.
   - Select your Ollama credential.
   - Set the Model to `phi3:mini`.
   - In the Prompt field, use an expression to pass the chat message from the trigger node (e.g., `{{$json["message"]}}`).
   d. **Connect the Nodes**
   - Connect the Chat Trigger node to the Ollama node.
   e. (Optional) **Add a Response Node**
   - Add a node to send the Ollama response back to the chat or another destination.

4. **Activate the Workflow**
- Click Activate in the top right.

5. **Test the Workflow**
- Send a message to the chat trigger.
- The workflow should pass the message to Ollama and return the model’s response.

Let me know if you want a step-by-step for a specific chat integration (Telegram, web chat, etc.) or help with workflow export/import!

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I have in the data folder the 7 harry potter books in french as pdf. I want to do some data analysis on their content. Specifically, I would like to determine :
- the number of times Harry touches his scar,
- the number of times Hermione says "Mais",
- the number of times Dumbledore changes the course of history,
- a comparison of the number of times Hermione, Harry and Ron respectively say something,
- the number of time Rogue acts in a dark or mysterious manner,
- the number of actions morally reprehensible according to french or Poudlard law happening in the books

I want to do this for each book and get some stats and trends.

I would you suggest I go about doing this?

**GitHub Copilot**: Here’s a step-by-step approach to analyze the content of the Harry Potter books in French PDFs for your specific questions:

### 1. Extract Text from PDFs
- Use a Python library like `PyPDF2`, `pdfplumber`, or `pdfminer.six` to extract text from each PDF.
- Save the extracted text for each book as a `.txt` file for easier processing.

### 2. Preprocess the Text
- Clean the text: remove headers, footers, page numbers, and non-content artifacts.
- Normalize the text (lowercase, remove extra spaces, etc.).

### 3. Define Search Patterns
- For each question, define keywords or regular expressions:
  - Harry touches his scar: e.g., “Harry toucha sa cicatrice”, “Harry porta la main à sa cicatrice”, etc.
  - Hermione says “Mais”: look for dialogue lines starting with Hermione and containing “Mais”.
  - Dumbledore changes history: search for narrative actions by Dumbledore that imply changing events (may require manual review or NLP).
  - Compare dialogue: count lines where Hermione, Harry, or Ron are speaking.
  - Rogue acts dark/mysterious: search for verbs/actions associated with Rogue (Snape) and adjectives like “sombre”, “mystérieux”, etc.
  - Morally reprehensible actions: define a list of actions (e.g., “voler”, “tuer”, “tricher”, etc.) and search for their occurrences.

### 4. Implement Analysis Scripts
- Write Python scripts to:
  - Count occurrences for each pattern in each book.
  - Aggregate and compare results across books.

### 5. Visualize Results
- Use `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to plot trends and comparisons.

### 6. (Optional) Use NLP for Complex Queries
- For nuanced actions (Dumbledore changing history, morally reprehensible acts), use NLP techniques:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify characters.
  - Sentiment analysis or custom classifiers to detect “morally reprehensible” actions.

### 7. Organize Output
- Create summary tables and visualizations for each book and overall trends.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Set up a Python environment and install necessary packages (`pdfplumber`, `re`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
- Extract text from one book as a test.
- Start with simple keyword searches, then refine patterns as needed.

Would you like to start with the code to extract text from the PDFs? Or do you want a project structure scaffold for this analysis?

Your notebook is set up to extract and normalize the text from the Harry Potter French PDF books.
Here’s the workflow in the notebook:

1. **Import Required Libraries**: Installs and imports `pdfplumber`, `os`, `glob`, `re`, and `string`.
2. **Locate PDF Files**: Lists all PDF files in the data folder.
3. **Extract Text from PDFs**: Extracts text from each PDF and saves it as a `.txt` file.
4. **Normalize Extracted Text**: Converts text to lowercase, removes punctuation and extra spaces, and saves normalized text as `_norm.txt` files.

You can now run the notebook step by step to generate normalized text files for each book.
Let me know when you’re ready to proceed to the analysis phase or if you want to adjust the extraction/normalization steps!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: One thing I'm concerned with punctuation removal, isn't punctuation important in determining when someone is talking?

**GitHub Copilot**: You are absolutely right—punctuation is crucial for identifying dialogue, especially quotation marks and colons (e.g., « », “ ”, :, -) that indicate when a character is speaking. Removing all punctuation would make it much harder to detect who says what.

**Recommendation:**
- For dialogue analysis, keep punctuation (at least quotation marks and colons) in the normalized text.
- You can create two versions: one fully normalized (for general analysis) and one “dialogue-friendly” version that preserves key punctuation for speaker detection.

Would you like to update the notebook to preserve dialogue-related punctuation in a separate normalized file?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: yes please

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

The notebook now creates a “dialogue-friendly” normalized version for each book, preserving quotation marks, colons, and dashes—essential for speaker and dialogue detection.

You can run the new cell to generate these files (ending in `_dialogue.txt`).
Ready for the next analysis step, or do you want to further refine the normalization?

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I'd rather have one source for all the analysis

**GitHub Copilot**: To keep things simple and consistent, you should use the “dialogue-friendly” normalized text (which preserves key punctuation) as your single source for all analyses. This version allows you to detect dialogue, count words, and perform other text-based analyses without losing important context.

**Next step:**
- Remove the creation of the fully normalized version (without punctuation).
- Use only the “dialogue-friendly” normalized text for all future analysis.

Would you like me to update the notebook so it only produces the `_dialogue.txt` files and removes the other normalization step?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: yes

You can use these files as your single source for further data analysis on the books.

Ready to move on to the next analysis step or add new features?

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Let's just try keeping punctuation all together for the time being. Now how can I do the different tasks I listed earlier?

**GitHub Copilot**: Here’s how you can approach each of your analysis tasks using the extracted text (with punctuation preserved):

---

### 1. Number of times Harry touches his scar
- Search for phrases like “Harry toucha sa cicatrice”, “Harry porta la main à sa cicatrice”, etc.
- Use regular expressions to find variations.

### 2. Number of times Hermione says "Mais"
- Find dialogue lines where Hermione is the speaker and says “Mais”.
- Use regex to match lines starting with Hermione’s name and containing “Mais”.

### 3. Number of times Dumbledore changes the course of history
- Search for narrative sentences involving Dumbledore and verbs like “changea”, “modifia”, “décida”, “intervint”, etc.
- This may require manual review or more advanced NLP to detect context.

### 4. Compare the number of times Hermione, Harry, and Ron say something
- Count dialogue lines attributed to each character.
- Use regex to match lines starting with their names or preceded by dialogue punctuation.

### 5. Number of times Rogue acts in a dark or mysterious manner
- Search for sentences involving Rogue (Snape) and adjectives/verbs like “sombre”, “mystérieux”, “sinistre”, “menaçant”, etc.

### 6. Number of morally reprehensible actions (French or Hogwarts law)
- Define a list of actions (e.g., “voler”, “tuer”, “tricher”, “mentir”, “agresser”, etc.).
- Count occurrences and review context for accuracy.

---

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Search Patterns**
   Create lists of keywords/phrases for each task.

2. **Write Analysis Functions**
   For each task, write a Python function that:
   - Loads the text file.
   - Searches for the patterns.
   - Counts and returns the results.

3. **Aggregate Results**
   Run the functions for each book and collect the stats.

4. **Visualize Trends**
   Use `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to plot results.

---

Would you like me to add code cells to your notebook for these analysis functions, starting with a template for one or two tasks? If so, which ones would you like to see first?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I thin I'd rather use a LLM for the more complex tasks. For the first one for example, we can Identify all the instances of "cicatrice", extract a window of context, and save it in a list. Then for each element of the list, we can ask a LLM to determine wether or not it correspond to Harry touching his scar. We can do something similar for Dumbledore changing the course of history, Rogue being mysterious/dark. Simpler ones like number of "Mais" said by Hermione or the number of time Harry/Hermione/Ron speak can be done by identifying speech markers ("—") and determining who's speeking using NLP. For each task, write a cell to realise the task. The number of "Mais" can be done after identifying all the times Hermione speaks for efficiency's sake. For the cases where we want to use a LLM, lists should be saved to files

Your notebook now contains a dedicated cell for each analysis task:

1. **Extract context windows for “cicatrice”** (for LLM classification of Harry touching his scar).
2. **Extract context windows for Dumbledore and history-changing actions** (for LLM review).
3. **Extract context windows for Rogue and dark/mysterious actions** (for LLM review).
4. **Identify and count speech by Harry, Hermione, and Ron** (and save Hermione’s lines for further analysis).
5. **Count the number of times Hermione says “Mais”** (using her identified speech).

For LLM-based tasks, context lists are saved to JSON files for easy review/classification.
You can now run each cell to generate the data needed for manual or LLM-assisted analysis.
Ready to proceed with further automation, visualization, or LLM integration?

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Every thing is saved in the data folder without organisation. Let's put the pdf in a source folder, the txt in a preprocessing folder and each specific task in its dedicated folder. Also the number of time Harry, Ron and Hermione speak should be compted individually for each book and saved. Same for the number of "mais" said by Hermione.

- preprocessing for TXT files
- cicatrice, dumbledore, rogue, speech, and mais for each specific analysis task

Next, I will update your notebook so that:
- PDFs are read from source
- TXT files are saved to and read from preprocessing
- Each analysis task saves its results in its dedicated folder
- The number of times Harry, Ron, and Hermione speak, and the number of “Mais” said by Hermione, are counted and saved individually for each book

I will proceed to update the notebook code accordingly.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Ok I want to change some things. First the context window for dumbledore and rogue should be increased. Let's say to 100. Also "snape" can be removed from the rogue_keywords as we are analysing the french version. The history keywords should be removed from dumbledore. When it comes to number of time harry, ron and hermione speak, we should use nlp to determine the speaker, not just if "Harry" is in the sentence because someone can be talking to Harry and use his name. Once the speaker is identified, we can determine wether it's Harry, Ron or Hermione and tally.

Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

Your requested changes are complete:
- The context window for Dumbledore and Rogue is now 100.
- "snape" is removed from Rogue keywords (French version uses "rogue" and "severus").
- History keywords are removed from the Dumbledore context extraction.
- Speaker identification for Harry, Ron, and Hermione now uses spaCy NLP (French model) to detect named entities, making the tally more accurate.

You can now run the updated cells for improved context extraction and speaker analysis. Let me know if you need further refinements or want to add more NLP features!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I'm not against using sapcy but if we do we need to import it first. Also I don't believe the new method for finding the speaker is any better. In order to determine the speaker, we need to find a verb associated to a character suggesting that said character is speaking

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

The notebook now determines the speaker by searching for speech verbs (e.g., "dit", "répondit", "demanda") directly associated with a character's name (e.g., "dit Harry", "Hermione demanda"). This method is more reliable for identifying who is speaking in the dialogue.

No external NLP library is required for this approach, so you don't need to import spaCy.
You can now run the updated cell for more accurate speaker attribution and tallying.

Let me know if you want to refine the verb list or add more advanced parsing!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Can you think of more verbs? I can think of chuchoter for exemple

**GitHub Copilot**: Absolutely! Here are more French verbs commonly used to indicate speech in literature, including your suggestion "chuchoter":

- chuchota, chuchoter (whispered)
- répondit (answered)
- demanda (asked)
- s’exclama (exclaimed)
- ajouta (added)
- murmura (murmured)
- cria (shouted)
- interrogea (questioned)
- souffla (breathed)
- proposa (proposed)
- lança (threw/said)
- affirma (affirmed)
- insista (insisted)
- objecta (objected)
- suggéra (suggested)
- poursuivit (continued)
- déclara (declared)
- précisa (specified)
- supposa (supposed)
- continua (continued)
- répliqua (replied)
- soupira (sighed)
- ordonna (ordered)
- expliqua (explained)
- plaisanta (joked)
- grogna (grumbled)
- gronda (scolded)
- s’écria (cried out)
- balbutia (stammered)
- articula (articulated)
- protesta (protested)
- approuva (approved)
- confia (confided)
- admit (admitted)
- demanda (asked)
- siffla (hissed)
- lança (launched/said)
- déclara (declared)
- chuchota (whispered)
- bredouilla (mumbled)
- gémit (moaned)
- hurla (yelled)
- plaisanta (joked)
- s’exclama (exclaimed)
- s’indigna (became indignant)
- s’étonna (was surprised)
- s’inquiéta (worried)
- s’énerva (got annoyed)

You can expand your `speech_verbs` list with these. Would you like me to update the notebook cell to include all these verbs?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Please expand the list

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

The list of speech verbs has been greatly expanded to include many more French verbs and expressions commonly used for dialogue attribution in literature.

You can now run the updated cell for more accurate speaker detection.
Let me know if you want to further refine the verb list or add more advanced linguistic features!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Let's remove the "s'" from the verb as they are not usefull. I'm also not conviced by the way we attempt to associate a verb to a character as there could easily be an adjective between the verb and the subjet. For exemple "s'exclama bruyament Harry". How else could the speaker be associated to the verb?

**GitHub Copilot**: Great observation!
To improve speaker attribution, you can use regular expressions to match patterns where the verb and character name are within a short window, allowing for adjectives or adverbs in between. For example:

- `verbe [adjectif/adverbe optionnel] nom`
- `nom [adjectif/adverbe optionnel] verbe`

A regex like this (for each verb and character) can help:
- `r"{verb}\\s+\\w*\\s+{name}"` and `r"{name}\\s+\\w*\\s+{verb}"`

You can also allow up to 2 words between the verb and the character name:
- `r"{verb}(?:\\s+\\w+){{0,2}}\\s+{name}"`
- `r"{name}(?:\\s+\\w+){{0,2}}\\s+{verb}"`

Would you like me to update the notebook cell to use this regex-based approach and remove the "s'" from the verb list?

**GitHub Copilot**: Summarized conversation history

Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

The speaker attribution cell (cell 13) in your notebook has been updated to use regex for more robust matching. This approach now allows up to three words (adjectives/adverbs) between the speech verb and the character name, in either order (e.g., "dit calmement Harry" or "Harry, tout bas, dit"). All "s'" forms have been removed from the verb list as requested.

You can now rerun this cell to get more accurate speaker counts and contexts for Harry, Hermione, and Ron. Let me know if you want further refinements or visualizations!

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: With such a long speech_verb list the processing is very slow. I need you to greatly improve the processing speed

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

The speaker attribution cell (cell 13) is now optimized for speed. All regex patterns for (verb, character) combinations are precompiled before processing, and the nested loops have been minimized. This will greatly improve performance, even with a long `speech_verbs` list.

You can rerun the cell for much faster results. Let me know if you need further acceleration or want to parallelize across books!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I want to make some changes. First the step from source txt to preprocessing seems to remove the linebreaks. I would like to keep them. Also, "\n-" should be replaced by "\n—" in the source txt. Finally, speech separator should be identified with "\n—" and not just "—"

Your requested changes are complete:

- Linebreaks are now preserved during normalization from source txt to preprocessing.
- All "\n-" are replaced by "\n—" in the source txt for consistent dialogue separation.
- The speech separator in all downstream code is now "\n—" (not just "—").

You can rerun the relevant cells for improved dialogue extraction and speaker attribution. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: For the "mais" identification, we should look for " mais " or "—mais ". Otherwise words containing "mais" could be counted aswell

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

I have read the cicatrice context JSONs for all seven Harry Potter books. I will now analyze each book's contexts and count the number of times a quote suggests Harry touches his scar, and collect the corresponding line IDs.

Touching the scar will be detected by French expressions such as:
- "touche sa cicatrice"
- "porta la main à sa cicatrice"
- "toucha sa cicatrice"
- "caressa sa cicatrice"
- "effleura sa cicatrice"
- "doigt sur sa cicatrice"
- "main sur sa cicatrice"
- "palpa sa cicatrice"
- "frottant sa cicatrice"
- "gratte sa cicatrice"
- "appuya sur sa cicatrice"
- "frôla sa cicatrice"

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: There is one final task that we haven't yet tackled. We need to count the number of morally reprehensible acts according to Poudlard (the school) or French law. How could we do that?

**GitHub Copilot**: To count the number of morally reprehensible acts according to Poudlard or French law, you should:

1. **Define a list of keywords and phrases** that represent such acts (e.g., "meurtre", "vol", "torture", "cruauté", "trahison", "sortilège interdit", "impardonnable", "kidnapping", "chantage", "abus", "violence", "corruption", "discrimination", "harcèlement", "empoisonnement", "usage de magie noire", etc.).

2. **Optionally, create a mapping of acts to their legal/moral category** (e.g., "meurtre" → "crime", "sortilège interdit" → "violation du règlement de Poudlard").

3. **Scan the normalized text or context files** for these keywords/phrases, using a context window to capture surrounding text for manual review or LLM classification.

4. **Count and log each occurrence** in a summary JSON, optionally with line/context for later validation.

5. **(Advanced) Use a language model** to classify ambiguous cases or to refine the detection (e.g., is the act described really a crime, or just mentioned?).

**Implementation Example:**
- Add a new cell to your notebook that:
  - Defines the keywords/phrases.
  - Iterates through the normalized text files.
  - Counts and saves the results in a summary JSON.

Would you like a ready-to-use code cell for this? If so, specify if you want just keyword matching, or if you want to use a more advanced approach (e.g., LLM or rule-based classification).

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: That's a good start but it's not exhaustive enough. Because these "illegal" acts should include students doing something they're not supposed to do for example. How can our strategy be amended to detect these types of acts aswel?

**GitHub Copilot**: To detect a broader range of "illegal" or morally reprehensible acts—including students breaking school rules—you should:

1. **Expand your keyword/phrase list** to include not only crimes and forbidden spells, but also school rule violations and typical student misbehavior. Examples: "interdit", "règlement", "punition", "détention", "tricher", "voler", "sortilège interdit", "sortilège impardonnable", "sortir la nuit", "passer outre", "désobéir", "cacher", "mentir", "bagarre", "duel", "utiliser la magie hors de Poudlard", "pénétrer dans la forêt interdite", "utiliser la salle de bain des préfets", "utiliser la cape d'invisibilité", "contourner la sécurité", "fugue", "sortir sans autorisation", etc.

2. **Include context-based patterns**: Look for phrases like "n'avait pas le droit", "n'est pas autorisé", "a enfreint", "a été puni", "a reçu une retenue", "a été exclu", "a été réprimandé", "a été surpris", "a été attrapé", etc.

3. **Use regular expressions** to catch variations and more complex patterns (e.g., "a été pris en train de", "a été surpris en train de", "a reçu une sanction", "a été convoqué par le directeur").

4. **Optionally, scan for dialogue or narration indicating rule-breaking** (e.g., "McGonagall a donné une retenue à", "Dumbledore a averti", "Filch a attrapé", "Snape a puni", etc.).

5. **Review and refine**: After initial keyword/context extraction, manually review or use a language model to filter out false positives and ambiguous cases.

6. **Log all detected acts** with context, book, and line number for later analysis or validation.

**Summary of the amended strategy:**
- Use a much broader set of keywords and context patterns.
- Include both explicit crimes and implicit school rule violations.
- Use regex and context windows to capture indirect mentions.
- Optionally, use LLMs for ambiguous or complex cases.

Would you like a code cell that implements this expanded strategy for your notebook?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Yes add a cell to implement this strategy

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

A new code cell has been added to your notebook. It detects and counts morally reprehensible acts—including crimes, forbidden magic, and school rule violations—using an expanded keyword/context strategy. Results are saved in `data/illegal/illegal_acts_summary.json` for all books.

**GitHub Copilot**: Edit [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N22/harry_potter_text_extraction.ipynb)

The notebook now processes each book individually, saving the extracted contexts of potentially illegal acts in separate JSON files (one per book) in the illegal folder. No count is included, so you can analyze the contexts in depth later. Each file is named `{book_name}_illegal_contexts.json`. The workflow is ready for your next analysis step.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Ok let's now analyse these json like we did for dumbledore, rogue or the scar tasks. Start by creating the summary json. Then, read the json for the first book, analyse the lines to identify illegal acts and count the number of unique illegal acts. Then report your findings in the summary json. During your analysis, make sure that you aren't counting mutliple time a singular illegal act (multiple line could be associated to a single act). Also only count actual actions, not a description of something that would consitute an illegal act.

I will now analyze the first book's illegal act contexts to identify and count unique actual illegal acts (not descriptions or hypothetical cases), then report the findings in the summary JSON.

### Step 1: Identify actual illegal acts (not descriptions or rules)
- Ignore mentions of rules, warnings, or hypothetical situations.
- Only count actions that are actually committed by a character in the story.

#### Examples of actual illegal acts in Book 1:
- Harry found on the school roof (implied rule violation, but not an explicit action).
- Dudley receives a pig tail from Hagrid (magical punishment, not an illegal act).
- The escape of the boa constrictor (Harry causes the snake to escape at the zoo).
- Neville's Remembrall theft by Malfoy (Malfoy steals Neville's item).
- Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Draco out of bed at night (violation of school rules).
- Hagrid keeps a dragon (illegal under wizard law).
- Students enter the forbidden corridor/forest (explicitly forbidden by school rules).
- Fred and George steal food from the kitchen.
- Use of magic outside school (Harry threatens to use magic on Dudley, but does not actually do it).

#### Filtering for unique acts:
- Multiple lines may refer to the same act (e.g., the dragon incident, forbidden corridor).
- Only count each act once per incident, not per mention.

### Step 2: Count unique illegal acts

#### List of unique illegal acts in Book 1:
1. Malfoy steals Neville's Remembrall.
2. Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Draco out of bed at night (forbidden corridor).
3. Hagrid keeps a dragon (Norbert).
4. Fred and George steal food from the kitchen.
5. Students enter the forbidden forest as punishment.
6. Use of magic outside school (Hagrid, not Harry).
7. Students duel at midnight (Harry and Draco plan a duel, but it is interrupted).
8. Students enter the restricted section of the library (Harry with the invisibility cloak).

#### Final count: 8 unique actual illegal acts.

### Step 3: Update summary JSON

I will now update `illegal_acts_summary.json` with the findings for Book 1.

    "acts": [
      "Malfoy vole le Rapeltout de Neville.",

      "Hagrid garde un dragon (Norbert) dans sa cabane.",
      "Fred et George volent de la nourriture dans la cuisine.",
      "Les élèves entrent dans la forêt interdite comme punition.",
      "Usage de magie hors de l'école (Hagrid).",
      "Projet de duel à minuit entre Harry et Draco (interrompu).",
      "Harry entre dans la réserve de la bibliothèque avec la cape d'invisibilité."
    ]
  }
}
```

Here is the analysis for the second book, "Harry Potter et la Chambre des Secrets":

### Unique actual illegal acts (not descriptions or hypothetical cases):

1. Harry and Ron fly the enchanted car to Hogwarts (violation of wizard law and Muggle secrecy).
2. Fred, George, and Ron use the enchanted car to rescue Harry from the Dursleys (illegal use of magic and car).
3. Students out of bed at night (school rule violation, especially Harry and Ron after arriving at Hogwarts).
4. Hermione steals ingredients from Snape’s office for Polyjuice Potion (theft and potion brewing without permission).
5. Students brew Polyjuice Potion in secret (forbidden magic, multiple rule violations).
6. Entering the Forbidden Forest without permission (Harry and Ron).

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I want to do speech recognition to detect spells from Harry Potter. I've used WhisperX in a previous project for stt but I'm worried it won't be able to even transcribe a spell from speech to text. What are your thoughts?

**GitHub Copilot**: WhisperX (and Whisper) are strong general-purpose speech-to-text models, but they may struggle with rare or fictional words like Harry Potter spells, especially if those words are not in their training data or are pronounced unusually.

Here are some considerations and strategies:

1. **Transcription Accuracy**: WhisperX may mis-transcribe spells (e.g., "Expelliarmus" as "expel your mouse") due to their rarity and phonetic similarity to real words.

2. **Custom Vocabulary**: WhisperX does not natively support custom vocabulary or biasing towards specific words. However, you can post-process its output to match spell names using fuzzy matching or a spell dictionary.

3. **Fine-tuning**: If you have audio samples of spells, fine-tuning a model (if supported) or training a custom model could improve accuracy, but WhisperX is not easily fine-tuned by end users.

4. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Use WhisperX for initial transcription, then apply a spell-matching algorithm (Levenshtein distance, regex, etc.) to map the output to known spells.
   - Consider using a keyword spotting model trained specifically on spell names if you have enough data.

5. **Practical Workflow**:
   - Transcribe audio with WhisperX.
   - Compare the transcription to a list of Harry Potter spells using fuzzy string matching.
   - If the match is close enough, treat it as a detected spell.

Would you like help setting up a workflow that combines WhisperX transcription with spell detection using fuzzy matching?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Yes let's do that

**GitHub Copilot**: Great! Here’s the plan:

1. Use WhisperX to transcribe speech to text.
2. Compare the transcription to a list of Harry Potter spells using fuzzy string matching.
3. Output the detected spell if the match is close enough.

Let’s break this down into actionable steps:
- Prepare a list of Harry Potter spells.
- Implement a fuzzy matching function (using Python’s `difflib` or `rapidfuzz`).
- Write a script that takes WhisperX output and matches it to the spell list.

I’ll start by creating a Python file with the spell list and the fuzzy matching logic.

Created [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/harry_potter_spells.py)

Created [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/spell_matcher.py)

The initial setup is ready:

- harry_potter_spells.py contains a list of spells.
- spell_matcher.py provides a function to match transcribed text to the closest spell using fuzzy matching.

Next steps:
- Integrate WhisperX transcription output with this matching logic.
- Optionally, expand the spell list or improve matching with libraries like `rapidfuzz` for better accuracy.

Let me know if you want to connect this to WhisperX, run a test, or add more spells!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Ok let's implement whisperX. It should be a script that's given an audio file path as argument and saves the transcription as a text file

**GitHub Copilot**: Read [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/harry_potter_spells.py)

Created [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/whisperx_transcribe.py)

The script whisperx_transcribe.py is ready. It takes an audio file path and an output text file path as arguments, transcribes the audio using WhisperX, and saves the result.

However, the error indicates that the `whisperx` package is not installed in your environment.
To proceed, you need to install WhisperX. Would you like me to install it for you?

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: now create an app with a simple front that allows the user to record a their voice, transcribe the audio with whisper matches with a spell and returns the result to the user. If you have questions start by asking them

**GitHub Copilot**: To create this app, I need to know your preferred technology stack for the frontend and backend. Here are some options:

- **Frontend:** React, Flask (with HTML), Streamlit, or another framework?
- **Backend:** Python (Flask, FastAPI), Node.js, etc.
- **Deployment:** Local only, or do you want it to be accessible over a network?

Do you have a preference for any of these, or should I choose a simple Python Flask app with a basic HTML/JS frontend?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Let's do flask, fastapi and local deployment. I'd like to do as much as possible in python

**GitHub Copilot**: Perfect! Here’s the plan:

- **Backend:** FastAPI (handles audio upload, transcription with WhisperX, spell matching, returns result)
- **Frontend:** Simple HTML/JS (served by FastAPI) for recording and uploading audio
- **Local deployment:** Everything runs locally, mostly in Python

Steps:
1. Set up FastAPI backend with endpoints for:
   - Serving the frontend
   - Receiving audio uploads
   - Transcribing audio and matching spells
2. Create a simple HTML/JS frontend for recording and uploading audio
3. Integrate WhisperX and spell matching logic

I’ll start by scaffolding the FastAPI backend and basic frontend files.

Created [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/main.py)

The FastAPI backend (main.py) is set up, but you need to install the following Python packages for it to work:

- fastapi
- uvicorn
- whisperx

Would you like me to install these dependencies for you now?

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Create a requirements for the dependencies

**GitHub Copilot**: Created [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/requirements.txt)

A requirements.txt file has been created with the necessary dependencies:
- fastapi
- uvicorn
- whisperx

You can install them using:
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, I'll create the simple HTML/JS frontend for recording and uploading audio. Let me know if you want any specific design or features!

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Let's create the frontend

**GitHub Copilot**: Created [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/static)

Created [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/static/index.html)

The frontend is ready!
- Users can record their voice, play back the audio, and upload it for transcription and spell detection.
- The result (transcription and detected spell) is displayed on the page.

You can now run the FastAPI app and access the interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

Would you like instructions for running the app, or do you want to test it now?

Made changes.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: How do I run the app?

**GitHub Copilot**: To run the app locally:

1. Install the dependencies:
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the FastAPI server:
```zsh
python main.py
```

3. Open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

You can now use the interface to record, transcribe, and detect spells!

**GitHub Copilot**: Your installation failed due to a network timeout while downloading a large package (torch). This can happen with slow or unstable internet connections, or if the package is very large.

Here are some ways to resolve this:

1. **Retry the installation:**
   Sometimes, simply running the command again works:
   ```zsh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Increase the pip timeout:**
   You can set a longer timeout to give pip more time to download:
   ```zsh
   pip install --default-timeout=600 -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Upgrade pip:**
   Sometimes a newer pip version handles large downloads better:
   ```zsh
   python3.12 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

4. **Install torch separately:**
   Download and install torch first, then install the rest:
   ```zsh
   pip install torch
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

If you continue to have issues, you can try downloading the wheel file manually from [PyTorch's official site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and installing it with:
```zsh
pip install /path/to/torch-*.whl
```

Let me know if you need more help with this!

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I keep timing out on this specific download, is there a workaround?
Downloading nvidia_cudnn_cu12-9.10.2.21-py3-none-manylinux_2_27_x86_64.whl (706.8 MB)

**GitHub Copilot**: Here are some workarounds for persistent timeouts on large package downloads like `nvidia_cudnn_cu12`:

1. **Increase pip timeout:**
   Run with a much longer timeout:
   ```zsh
   pip install --default-timeout=1200 nvidia_cudnn_cu12
   ```

2. **Download manually:**
   - Go to [PyPI nvidia_cudnn_cu12 page](https://pypi.org/project/nvidia-cudnn-cu12/#files) or NVIDIA’s official site.
   - Download the `.whl` file using your browser or a download manager.
   - Install it locally:
     ```zsh
     pip install /path/to/nvidia_cudnn_cu12-*.whl
     ```

3. **Use a faster mirror:**
   Try installing from a different mirror:
   ```zsh
   pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple --trusted-host pypi.org nvidia_cudnn_cu12
   ```

4. **Use a download manager:**
   Use `wget` or `curl` to download the wheel file, then install with pip.

5. **Check your internet connection:**
   If possible, use a wired connection or a faster network.

6. **Install only CPU dependencies:**
   If you don’t need GPU support, you can install the CPU-only version of torch and skip CUDA/CuDNN packages:
   ```zsh
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```

Let me know if you want to switch to CPU-only or need help with manual download!

         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: module 'torchaudio' has no attribute 'AudioMetaData'

**GitHub Copilot**: The error `AttributeError: module 'torchaudio' has no attribute 'AudioMetaData'` suggests a version mismatch between `torchaudio` and the libraries that depend on it (like `pyannote.audio` and `whisperx`). This often happens if you have a newer version of `torchaudio` than what is expected.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check your torchaudio version:**
   ```zsh
   pip show torchaudio
   ```

2. **Uninstall torchaudio:**
   ```zsh
   pip uninstall torchaudio
   ```

3. **Install a compatible version (usually 2.1.0 or 2.0.2 for recent WhisperX):**
   ```zsh
   pip install torchaudio==2.1.0
   ```
   If you still get errors, try:
   ```zsh
   pip install torchaudio==2.0.2
   ```

4. **Restart your FastAPI app and try again.**

**Why?**
Recent versions of `torchaudio` (e.g., 2.2.x, 2.3.x) have breaking changes. Many speech libraries expect an older API.

Let me know if you need help updating your requirements.txt or want to pin compatible versions for all dependencies!

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torchaudio==2.1.0 (from versions: 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.3.0, 2.3.1, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.5.0, 2.5.1, 2.6.0, 2.7.0, 2.7.1, 2.8.0, 2.9.0)

**GitHub Copilot**: The available versions of `torchaudio` on your system are newer than 2.1.0, which means 2.1.0 is not published for your Python version or platform.

**Workaround:**
- Try the lowest available version, e.g. `torchaudio==2.2.0`:
  ```zsh
  pip install torchaudio==2.2.0
  ```
- If you still get the same error, try each version upwards (2.2.1, 2.2.2, etc.) until you find one that works with `whisperx` and `pyannote.audio`.

**If all fail:**
- You may need to downgrade your Python version (e.g., to 3.10 or 3.11), as some older `torchaudio` releases are not built for Python 3.12.
- Alternatively, try installing the latest `torchaudio` and see if the error persists. Sometimes, updating all related packages (`torch`, `torchaudio`, `pyannote.audio`, `whisperx`) to their latest versions resolves compatibility issues.

Would you like to try with `torchaudio==2.2.0` and update your requirements.txt accordingly? Or do you want instructions for setting up a Python 3.10/3.11 environment for better compatibility?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
whisperx 3.7.2 requires torch>=2.7.1, but you have torch 2.2.0 which is incompatible.
whisperx 3.7.2 requires triton>=3.3.0; sys_platform == "linux" and platform_machine == "x86_64", but you have triton 2.2.0 which is incompatible.

**GitHub Copilot**: You are experiencing dependency conflicts because the versions of `torch` and `triton` required by `whisperx` are much newer than the ones you have installed. This is a common issue when using cutting-edge libraries with large dependencies.

**Here’s how to resolve it:**

1. **Upgrade torch and triton to the required versions:**
   ```zsh
   pip install 'torch>=2.7.1' 'triton>=3.3.0'
   ```

2. **Then install torchaudio to match the torch version:**
   ```zsh
   pip install torchaudio --upgrade
   ```

3. **Reinstall whisperx to ensure all dependencies are correct:**
   ```zsh
   pip install --force-reinstall whisperx
   ```

**Note:**
- These packages are very large and may take time to download.
- If you continue to have timeouts, try downloading the wheel files manually from the official PyTorch and Triton sites and install them with pip.

**If you want, I can update your requirements.txt to specify compatible versions for all dependencies. Would you like me to do that?**

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: So after all the version swaping I finally have solve dependency issues but I get the error again of AttributeError: module 'torchaudio' has no attribute 'AudioMetaData'

**GitHub Copilot**: This error means that the installed version of `torchaudio` is still not compatible with `pyannote.audio` (used by WhisperX). The latest `torchaudio` versions have removed or changed the `AudioMetaData` attribute.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check the compatible versions:**
   - `pyannote.audio` (and thus WhisperX) often works best with `torchaudio` matching the major version of `torch`.
   - For `torch>=2.7.1`, try `torchaudio==2.7.1`.

2. **Uninstall and reinstall torchaudio:**
   ```zsh
   pip uninstall torchaudio
   pip install torchaudio==2.7.1
   ```

3. **If you still get the error:**
   - Check the installed version:
     ```zsh
     python -c "import torchaudio; print(torchaudio.__version__)"
     ```
   - If it’s not 2.7.1, try the next closest version (e.g., 2.7.0, 2.8.0).

4. **If none of the available versions work:**
   - You may need to downgrade your Python environment to 3.10 or 3.11, as some wheels are not built for 3.12 yet.

**Summary:**
The error is due to a breaking change in `torchaudio`. Matching the `torch` and `torchaudio` versions as closely as possible is key. If you want, I can update your requirements.txt to pin `torchaudio==2.7.1` and add a comment about Python compatibility. Would you like me to do that?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Even trying to check the version raises this error: python -c "import pyannote.audio; print(pyannote.audio.__version__)"

         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: module 'torchaudio' has no attribute 'AudioMetaData'

**GitHub Copilot**: This confirms that your current `torchaudio` version is incompatible with `pyannote.audio` (and thus WhisperX). The root cause is that recent `torchaudio` versions (especially for Python 3.12) have removed or changed the `AudioMetaData` class, but `pyannote.audio` still expects it.

**Your options:**

1. **Downgrade Python to 3.10 or 3.11:**
   Most compatible versions of `torchaudio` and `pyannote.audio` are built for Python ≤3.11.
   - Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.10 or 3.11.
   - Reinstall your dependencies (torch, torchaudio, whisperx, pyannote.audio).

2. **Wait for upstream updates:**
   If you must use Python 3.12, you’ll need to wait for `pyannote.audio` to update for the new `torchaudio` API, or patch the library yourself (not recommended).

3. **Patch pyannote.audio manually:**
   You could try editing io.py to remove or update the reference to `torchaudio.AudioMetaData`, but this is fragile and not recommended for production.

**Recommended:**
Downgrade to Python 3.10 or 3.11 for full compatibility.
Would you like step-by-step instructions to set up a new environment with Python 3.10 or 3.11?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: How can I see my available environements?

**GitHub Copilot**: To see your available Python environments with `pyenv`, run:

```zsh
pyenv versions
```

This will list all installed Python versions and virtual environments.
The currently active environment will be marked with an asterisk (*).

If you want to see all virtual environments created with `venv` or `virtualenv`, you can also check their directories, but `pyenv versions` is the most direct way for your setup.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I've switched to an environement using python 3.10.6, do I just run the pip install of requirements.txt?

**GitHub Copilot**: Yes, after switching to your Python 3.10.6 environment, you should run:

```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the dependencies for your project in the new environment.
If you encounter any version conflicts, let me know and I can help you adjust your requirements.txt for compatibility.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Ok I ran the pip install and got this dependency error, will it be an issue?

ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
gensim 4.3.3 requires numpy<2.0,>=1.18.5, but you have numpy 2.0.2 which is incompatible.

**GitHub Copilot**: Yes, this will likely be an issue. `gensim` requires `numpy` version less than 2.0, but you have `numpy 2.0.2` installed. This can cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior in any code that uses `gensim`.

**How to fix:**
Downgrade `numpy` to a compatible version:
```zsh
pip install 'numpy<2.0'
```

This will install the latest compatible version (e.g., 1.26.x).
After downgrading, `gensim` should work correctly. If you don’t use `gensim` in your project, you can ignore the warning, but if you do, it’s best to fix it.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: That's what I'm asking, is gensim needed for this project?

**GitHub Copilot**: No, `gensim` is not needed for this Harry Potter spell recognition project.
Your app uses WhisperX, FastAPI, and fuzzy matching for spell detection—none of which require `gensim`.

You can safely ignore or uninstall `gensim` if you are not using it elsewhere:
```zsh
pip uninstall gensim
```

Let me know if you want to clean up your environment or update your requirements.txt!

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I still got the AttributeError: module 'torchaudio' has no attribute 'AudioMetaData' in this python 3.10.6 env. Is there no way to work around it?

**GitHub Copilot**: This error means that the installed version of `torchaudio` is still not compatible with the version of `pyannote.audio` (used by WhisperX). The `AudioMetaData` attribute was removed in recent `torchaudio` releases, but `pyannote.audio` expects it.

**Workarounds:**

1. **Try older versions of torchaudio and torch:**
   - Uninstall current versions:
     ```zsh
     pip uninstall torchaudio torch
     ```
   - Install compatible versions (these are known to work with `pyannote.audio` and WhisperX):
     ```zsh
     pip install torch==2.0.1 torchaudio==2.0.2
     ```
   - Then reinstall WhisperX and pyannote.audio:
     ```zsh
     pip install whisperx pyannote.audio
     ```

2. **If you still get the error:**
   - The latest `pyannote.audio` may not be compatible with any available `torchaudio` for your platform.
   - You can try installing an older version of `pyannote.audio`:
     ```zsh
     pip install pyannote.audio==2.1.1
     ```

3. **If none of the above work:**
   - WhisperX may have a CPU-only mode that does not require `pyannote.audio` (for VAD). You can try running WhisperX without VAD, or with `vad='none'` if the API allows.
   - Alternatively, use plain OpenAI Whisper (without WhisperX) for transcription, then apply your spell-matching logic.

4. **Manual patch (not recommended for production):**
   - You could edit the `pyannote.audio` source code to remove references to `AudioMetaData`, but this is fragile and may break other functionality.

**Summary:**
This is a known issue in the speech community. The best solution is to use older, compatible versions of `torch`, `torchaudio`, and `pyannote.audio` in a Python 3.10 environment. If you want, I can update your requirements.txt to pin these versions for you. Would you like me to do that?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: My setup has no gpu, also the transcribe audio function uses model = whisperx.load_model("large-v2", device="cpu")

**GitHub Copilot**: Thanks for clarifying your setup (CPU only, no GPU).
Your usage of `whisperx.load_model("large-v2", device="cpu")` is correct for CPU inference.

However, the `AttributeError: module 'torchaudio' has no attribute 'AudioMetaData'` is not related to GPU/CPU selection—it's a compatibility issue between `torchaudio` and `pyannote.audio` (used internally by WhisperX for VAD).

**Workarounds for CPU-only setup:**

1. **Disable VAD in WhisperX:**
   If you only need transcription (not speaker diarization or voice activity detection), you can disable VAD.
   Try changing your code to:
   ```python
   model = whisperx.load_model("large-v2", device="cpu", vad="none")
   ```
   Or, if `vad` is not a valid argument, check WhisperX docs for how to skip VAD.

2. **Use plain Whisper (OpenAI):**
   If WhisperX keeps failing due to VAD, you can use the original Whisper library for transcription:
   ```python
   import whisper
   model = whisper.load_model("large")
   result = model.transcribe(audio_path)
   text = result["text"]
   ```

3. **Ensure compatible versions:**
   If you need VAD, you must use compatible versions of `torch`, `torchaudio`, and `pyannote.audio` in Python 3.10.
   - torch==2.0.1
   - torchaudio==2.0.2
   - pyannote.audio==2.1.1

**Summary:**
For CPU-only transcription, disabling VAD or switching to plain Whisper is the most robust solution.
Would you like me to update your script to use plain Whisper or attempt to disable VAD in WhisperX?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: The issue persist. Can you modify everything to use whisper instead then?

**GitHub Copilot**: Using "Apply Patch"

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: I'm still getting the same error

**GitHub Copilot**: If you are still getting `AttributeError: module 'torchaudio' has no attribute 'AudioMetaData'` after switching to OpenAI Whisper, it means there is still some code or dependency trying to use `pyannote.audio` or an incompatible version of `torchaudio`.

**Checklist to resolve:**

1. **Uninstall unused packages:**
   ```zsh
   pip uninstall whisperx pyannote.audio
   ```

2. **Reinstall only the needed packages:**
   ```zsh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Check your script:**
   Make sure you are only importing and using `whisper`, not `whisperx` or `pyannote.audio`.

4. **Check for old files:**
   If you have other scripts or modules importing `whisperx` or `pyannote.audio`, update or remove those imports.

5. **Restart your Python environment:**
   Sometimes, old modules are cached. Restart your shell or IDE.

**Summary:**
The error should not occur with only OpenAI Whisper, torch, and torchaudio installed. If it persists, there may be a lingering import or an old file in your environment.

Would you like help searching your project for any remaining `whisperx` or `pyannote.audio` imports?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Actually the transcribe function was in main.py. Anyway I just tried to transcribe, at first it seemed to download something in terminal which I find odd: 100%|█████████████████████████████████████| 2.88G/2.88G [00:56<00:00, 54.4MiB/s]

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ffmpeg'

**GitHub Copilot**: The error `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ffmpeg'` means that Whisper requires `ffmpeg` to process audio files, but it is not installed on your system.

**To fix this:**

Install ffmpeg using your package manager:
```zsh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

After installing ffmpeg, restart your FastAPI app and try transcribing again.
This should resolve the error and allow Whisper to process your audio files.

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: So a few things, it took 5 minutes to transcribe a 1 second recording (which is way too long) in which I said "lumos". It got transcribed to "vimos", and no spell was detected

**GitHub Copilot**: Here’s what’s happening and how to improve your results:

1. **Transcription Speed:**
   The `large` Whisper model is very slow on CPU, especially for short recordings.
   - Use a smaller model for faster CPU inference:
     ```python
     model = whisper.load_model("base", device="cpu")
     ```
   - Models: `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large` (smaller = faster, but less accurate).

2. **Transcription Accuracy:**
   Whisper may mis-transcribe rare or fictional words like “lumos” as “vimos”.
   - Improve detection by using fuzzy matching (Levenshtein distance) with your spell list.
   - You can also try the `small` or `medium` model for better accuracy, but still faster than `large`.

3. **Spell Detection:**
   If the transcription is close but not exact, your spell matcher should allow for fuzzy matches (e.g., match “vimos” to “lumos” if similarity is high).

**Next steps:**
- Switch to a smaller Whisper model for speed.
- Tune your spell matcher to allow for fuzzy matches with a lower cutoff.

Would you like me to update your code to use the `base` model and improve fuzzy matching for spell detection?

**c-hoareau_onepoint**: Yes

**GitHub Copilot**: Read [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/main.py)

Read [](file:///home/camille/code/Camille9999/EPSI/M2/workshop-m2/N19/spell_matcher.py)

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```


Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Your app now uses the faster `base` Whisper model and a more forgiving fuzzy matching cutoff for spell detection.

This should:
- Greatly reduce transcription time on CPU
- Improve the chance of detecting spells even if the transcription is slightly off (e.g., "vimos" → "lumos")

Try recording and transcribing again. If you still have issues with accuracy or speed, let me know and I can suggest further optimizations!

Made changes.
